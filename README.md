  - **GitHub Copilot** AI-assisted development. This is going to be a game changer. &nbsp;âœ¨
    - For example, helped me fix a tricky Angular web [issue](https://github.com/smagara/AgilitySports_web/issues/1) with this [change](https://github.com/smagara/AgilitySports_web/pull/2/commits/fdec50fd43de72d22ffcbdc25f095e55dbbe14a8).<br/>
    - In *seconds* directed me to fix this menu style [issue](https://github.com/smagara/AgilitySports_web/issues/3) with a quick CSS [adjustment](https://github.com/smagara/AgilitySports_web/pull/4/commits/c039f95301deef8254f04f9140d38f4548d68cad).
    - Guided me through setting up a GitHub Action CI/CD pipeline for an Angular app.  This took some prompting.  The default Node deployment option produced 24,000 output files and was inefficient as well as scary.  Copilot at first suggested zip step in the yaml but this didn't sound right, since an ng build for deployment produces 4 output files.  After discussing this with Copilot the result was a simpler and faster pipeline [here](https://github.com/smagara/AgilitySports_web/blob/main/.github/workflows/deployAgilitySports.js.yml).  You have to keep prompting :).
    - I use it often now as a pair programmer and part-time architect with @workspace questions about better practices.
    - Completed the Microsoft Build Challenge "Accelerate Developer Productivity with GitHub and Azure for Developers"
  - **GitHub Project** tracking tools -- they now rival TFS/DevOps.
    - Check out this sample project: [AgilitySports Sample Project](https://github.com/users/smagara/projects/3/views/1).
    - This makes me curious about the Microsoft roadmap for DevOps/TFS as a tracking tool and sourcecode repository.
    - Keep up with project announcements [here](https://github.com/smagara/AgilitySports_web/discussions).
  - **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation, such as automated releases into Dev/Green regions on approved Pull requests.<br/>
  - **Azure** Cloud integration.
    - AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certified.
    - Azure SQL database setup and migration
    - Website and RESTful API hosting
    - Azure Functions as a lightweight serverless API alternative
    - Automated deployment pipelines
    - SQL database tracing techniques
    - Azure Entra Id Managed Identity service accounts for database access
    - Working toward the AI-900 (Artificial Intelligence) certification
